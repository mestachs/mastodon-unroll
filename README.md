# Mastodon thread unroll

Turn a mastodon thread into markdown content... 
So I can use it as blog draft article.

Want to test it ? https://mestachs.github.io/mastodon-unroll/

Also an occasion to try the new bun.sh bundler, react, gh-pages as an alternative deploy/dev workflow.


todos 
 - don't know why the hot reload doesn't seem to work
 - add options to filter out content from other person in the thread
 
## dev

```
bun run dev
```


## deploy to github pages
```
./script/build
```
